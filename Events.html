            <h1> Math teachers have risen up over society declaring war 0n all illogical beings. Patient zero, an ex algebra teacher at a top level school has infected all other teachers across the world with the intent to run it to ruins. Failed experiments have led to patient zero recieving the powers to re-write the laws of physics.

                The first outbreak has taken place in Scandinavia in a small off the grid operations center specilising in human experimentation, mutations on Patient Zero have resulted in him recieving the power to re-write the laws of physics. Zero has used his new found powers to break out of the lab and start turning other math teachers against their students.</h1>
